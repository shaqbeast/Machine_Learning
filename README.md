# Machine_Learning
Respository for CS 7641 @ GT

A respository folder for all homeworks and final project assignment for the Machine Learning Course at Georgia Tech (CS 7641)

Professor: Max Roozbahani

Course taken by: Shikhar Verma (Spring 2024)

All homeworks are conducted in "HW#.pynb" files (except HW1). Local tests and concepts are listed in these documents. The other files contain my code corresponding to what was asked in the homework in the Jupyter notebook. HW1 was mainly written rather than coding, so a latex document has been attached labeled as "HW1_Document_Answers" instead of a .pynb file.

The project folder is shown; however, it's still not complete yet as we're still fixing some portions of the implementation to increase accuracy. I implemented the "clean_and_prepare" portions for each of the .py files.
